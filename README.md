# Pose-Detector

## Overview

**Pose-Detector** is a Python application for real-time pose recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It captures video from a webcam and identifies various human poses such as **"T-Pose," "Hands Up," "Waving,"** and more. The application displays the detected pose labels on the video feed with a responsive Tkinter GUI.

## Features

- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: Uses MediaPipe for accurate pose landmark detection.
- **Pose Classification**: Recognizes multiple predefined poses based on joint positions and angles.
- **Dynamic Video Display**: Adjusts video feed size within a Tkinter window while maintaining aspect ratio.
- **Custom Pose Labels**: Displays detected pose names on the video feed for clear identification.

## Installation

To get started with Pose-Detector, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YashDotPie/Pose-Detector.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd Pose-Detector
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```
